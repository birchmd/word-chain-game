# Word Chain Game

A program which solves the "word chain game".
A word chain is a collection of words created by mutating one letter from the previous one, e.g. cat -> sat -> sit.
In the word chain game you are given two words and asked to find the length of the shortest word chain which connects them (if one exists).
As input we are given a list of words along with the two to find the chain between.
We assume all words in the given list are the same length, and are only made up of ASCII characters.
